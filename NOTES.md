This is the newest version of bitgame, now using redux. Before, I was trying to retrofit redux into my already-existing code. But then I decided it would be easier to start with a premade redux app - the counter app that is used as an example in the redux documentation - and then turn it into bitgame. The next challenge is to implement the rest of the bitgame functionality.

Implementation in redux is going well so far, except I just learned the hard way that you can't use dispatch inside a reducer function. Still not totally clear on all the concepts, but getting there. Hopefully today's class will help.
